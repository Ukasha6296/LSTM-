# LSTM-
Here I have done the project for design analysis of testing rig for simulating faults in hydrodynamic bearings.
Firstly, I designed and fabricated a test rig and mounted different sensors on the kit to get some data.
The data containes 9000 samples in which 3000 samples are for healthy bearings, 3000 are for unhealthy bearings (vibration and sound faults) and 3000 for imbalancement.
Furthermore, I trained LSTM model on the data sets of which 80% of data used for tarining and 20% for testing.
The train accuracy of model is 100% and test accuracy is 99%.
The model isn't overfit because the data that acquired is well preprocessed and clean.
